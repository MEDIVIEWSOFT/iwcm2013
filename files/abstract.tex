\begin{abstract}
As a CSE conference series, the Department of Computational Science
and Engineering is organizing International conference on
Computational Mathematics - Recent advances in finite element
methods during July 11-13, 2012. The conference aims to provide a
platform to disseminate recent developments in finite element
methods for various PDEs, enable in-depth technical discussions on a
wide variety of major computational efforts in science and
engineering, and foster the interdisciplinary culture required to
meet recent challenges in CSE. Further, it is planed to provide a
good exposure for students and young researchers and encourage them
to pursue their research career in these areas.
